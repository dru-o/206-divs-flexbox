                <p>December 2019 I propsed to my wife. It was December 22nd to be exact. Every year my wife and daughter makes sugar cookies for christmas and decorate them. This year was just the same except I decorated some to spell out "will you marry me?". It was a very special night for our family. I even had my daughter help with the proposel.</p>

                <p>She said yes so the palnning began. Three months into our planning the 2020 pandemic hit and we didnt know if we were even going to be able to get married. We continued to plan in hopes that but the end of 2020 the pandemic would subside enough for some opening of the state. Luckily we caught a window when the governor open things up a bit which allowed us to have our wedding with 50 of our family and friends.</p>

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                <p>The wedding was beautiful and off we were on our honeymoon. Our original plan was taking us  to the Netherlands but as the pandemic would have it we were shut out of other countries. We made the best of the situation and booked a trip to New Orleans. We had a good time in New Orleans, trying the local cusine, walking around the famous French Quarter, and hoping on the Historic St. Charles street car.  </p>
